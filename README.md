# First Innings Score Prediction - Indian Premier League (IPL)


### Problem statement:
Build a model to predict the first innings score of any IPL match (In terms of range).

### Dataset:
The dataset _'IPL Data Set.csv'_ consists of ball-to-ball informations about every match of IPL from __Season 1 to 10__ ie: (2008 to 2017)<br/>
Dataset consists following columns:<br/>
_• mid: Unique match id._<br/>
_• date: Date on which the match was played._<br/>
_• venue: Stadium where match was played._<br/>
_• batting_team: Batting team name._<br/>
_• bowling_team: Bowling team name._<br/>
_• batsman: Batsman who faced that particular ball._<br/>
_• bowler: Bowler who bowled that particular ball._<br/>
_• runs: Runs scored by team till that point of instance._<br/>
_• wickets: Number of Wickets fallen of the team till that point of instance._<br/>
_• overs: Number of Overs bowled till that point of instance._<br/>
_• runs_last_5: Runs scored in previous 5 overs._<br/>
_• wickets_last_5: Number of Wickets that fell in previous 5 overs._<br/>
_• striker: max(runs scored by striker, runs scored by non-striker)._<br/>
_• non-striker: min(runs scored by striker, runs scored by non-striker)._<br/>
_• total: Total runs scored by batting team at the end of first innings._<br/>

### Dependencies:
_• Python - 3.6_<br/>
_• Scikit-Learn_<br/>
_• Pandas_<br/>
_• Numpy_<br/>
_• Matplotlib_<br/>
_• Seaborn_<br/>

### Algorithms Used:
_• Linear Regression_<br/>
_• Decision Tree Regression_<br/>
_• Random Forest Regression_<br/>
_• Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) Algorithm_<br/>

### Future Scope:
_• Add columns in dataset of top batsmen and bowlers of all the teams._<br/>
_• Add columns that consists of striker and non-striker's strike rates._<br/>
_• Implement this problem statement using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)._<br/>
